                                Yes, bike insurance in Dubai is transferable when selling a motorcycle. The new owner must
                                provide their details, including name and contact information, to the insurance company to
                                transfer the policy. If the bike is gifted or donated, the new owner must update their
                                details with the insurer to ensure continuous coverage.

                                The cost of comprehensive bike insurance in the UAE typically ranges from AED 300 to AED
                                1,500 annually. The exact cost depends on factors such as the insurer, coverage level,
                                rider’s experience, and bike type. To save money, compare multiple quotes and check for
                                discounts, such as no-claim bonuses or safe rider rewards.

                                Yes, bike insurance is mandatory to renew your motorcycle’s registration in Dubai. Without
                                valid insurance, you cannot complete the renewal process, and your bike will be considered
                                unregistered, making it illegal to ride on public roads. To avoid fines and legal issues,
                                ensure your bike insurance is up to date before renewing your registration.
