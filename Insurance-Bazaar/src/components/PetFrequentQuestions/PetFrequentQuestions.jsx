                                The cost of pet insurance varies based on factors like the age, breed, and health of your pet,
                                as well as the level of coverage you choose. On average, it can range from $20 to $50 per month
                                for dogs, and $10 to $30 per month for cats.

                                Most pet insurance policies do not cover pre-existing conditions. However, some insurers may offer

                                through their website or mobile app.
