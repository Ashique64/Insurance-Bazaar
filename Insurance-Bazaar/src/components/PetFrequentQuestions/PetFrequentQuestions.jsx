                                Pet insurance helps cover medical expenses for your pets, including accidents, illnesses,
                                and preventive care. It ensures that your pets receive the necessary care without worrying
                                about expensive vet bills.

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The cost of pet insurance varies based on factors like the age, breed, and health of your
                                pet, as well as the level of coverage you choose. On average, it can range from $20 to $50
                                per month for dogs, and $10 to $30 per month for cats.

                                Most pet insurance policies do not cover pre-existing conditions. However, some insurers may
                                offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions if they have been cured or are in
                                remission.

                                To file a pet insurance claim, you'll typically need to submit a claim form along with your
                                petâ€™s medical records and receipts from the veterinary office. Some insurers allow online
                                claim submission through their website or mobile app.
